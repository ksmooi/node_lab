### 4. Installing uWebSockets.js with TypeScript

Let’s start by setting up a **Node.js** project with **`uWebSockets.js`** and **TypeScript**.

#### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm init -y
npm install uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v20.48.0
npm install typescript @types/node --save-dev
```

#### Step 2: Configure TypeScript

Create a `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "rootDir": "./src",
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

### 5. Creating a WebSocket Server with uWS

Now, let's build a simple WebSocket server using **`uWS`**. We'll create a WebSocket server that listens for connections, handles messages from clients, and allows us to broadcast messages to all connected clients.

#### Example: Basic WebSocket Server

```typescript
// src/server.ts
import uWS from 'uWebSockets.js';

const PORT = 9001;

// Create the WebSocket server
uWS.App()
  .ws('/*', {
    // On new WebSocket connection
    open: (ws) => {
      console.log('A client connected');
      ws.send('Welcome to the WebSocket server');
    },

    // On message received
    message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
      const decodedMessage = Buffer.from(message).toString();
      console.log('Message received:', decodedMessage);

      // Echo the message back to the client
      ws.send(`Echo: ${decodedMessage}`, isBinary);
    },

    // On client disconnection
    close: (ws, code, message) => {
      console.log(`Client disconnected: ${code}`);
    },
  })
  .listen(PORT, (token) => {
    if (token) {
      console.log(`WebSocket server listening on ws://localhost:${PORT}`);
    } else {
      console.log('Failed to listen on port', PORT);
    }
  });
```

#### Explanation:
- **`uWS.App()`**: Creates an instance of the `uWebSockets.js` server.
- **`ws()`**: Registers a WebSocket route (`/*` for all routes).
- **`open()`**: Triggered when a new WebSocket connection is opened.
- **`message()`**: Handles messages sent by the client.
- **`close()`**: Triggered when a client disconnects.
- **`listen()`**: Starts the server and listens on the specified port.

To run the server:

```bash
npx ts-node src/server.ts
```

This example sets up a basic WebSocket server that echoes back any message it receives from clients.

### 6. Adding HTTP Support to uWS

Besides WebSockets, `uWebSockets.js` also supports handling HTTP requests. Let's extend our server to handle both WebSocket and HTTP routes.

#### Example: WebSocket with HTTP Support

```typescript
// src/server.ts
import uWS from 'uWebSockets.js';

const PORT = 9001;

// Create the app with both HTTP and WebSocket routes
uWS.App()
  // Define an HTTP GET route
  .get('/hello', (res, req) => {
    res.end('Hello from the HTTP server');
  })

  // Define WebSocket behavior
  .ws('/*', {
    open: (ws) => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection opened');
      ws.send('Welcome to the WebSocket server');
    },

    message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
      const decodedMessage = Buffer.from(message).toString();
      console.log('Received message:', decodedMessage);
      ws.send(`Echo: ${decodedMessage}`, isBinary);
    },

    close: (ws, code, message) => {
      console.log(`Client disconnected: ${code}`);
    },
  })

  // Listen on the port
  .listen(PORT, (token) => {
    if (token) {
      console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
    } else {
      console.log('Failed to start the server');
    }
  });
```

#### Explanation:
- **`get('/hello')`**: Defines an HTTP GET route at `/hello`, which responds with a simple message.
- The server can now handle both WebSocket and HTTP requests on the same port.

### 7. Broadcasting with WebSockets

In real-time applications, broadcasting messages to multiple clients is essential. Let’s add broadcasting functionality so that when one client sends a message, it is broadcast to all connected clients.

#### Example: Broadcasting Messages to All Clients

```typescript
// src/server.ts
import uWS from 'uWebSockets.js';

const PORT = 9001;
const connectedClients: uWS.WebSocket[] = [];

uWS.App()
  .ws('/*', {
    open: (ws) => {
      console.log('Client connected');
      connectedClients.push(ws);
    },

    message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
      const decodedMessage = Buffer.from(message).toString();
      console.log('Message received:', decodedMessage);

      // Broadcast the message to all connected clients
      connectedClients.forEach((client) => {
        client.send(`Broadcast: ${decodedMessage}`, isBinary);
      });
    },

    close: (ws, code, message) => {
      console.log('Client disconnected');
      const index = connectedClients.indexOf(ws);
      if (index > -1) {
        connectedClients.splice(index, 1); // Remove client from array
      }
    },
  })
  .listen(PORT, (token) => {
    if (token) {
      console.log(`Server running on ws://localhost:${PORT}`);
    } else {
      console.log('Failed to listen on port', PORT);
    }
  });
```

#### Explanation:
- **`connectedClients`**: An array to keep track of all connected WebSocket clients.
- **Broadcasting**: When a message is received from one client, it is sent to all clients by iterating over `connectedClients`.

### 8. Handling WebSocket Events

In a real-world WebSocket application, handling events like connection, message, and disconnection is crucial. Let's look at how to handle these WebSocket events in a structured way.

#### WebSocket Events in uWS

```typescript


// src/server.ts
import uWS from 'uWebSockets.js';

uWS.App()
  .ws('/*', {
    // When the WebSocket connection opens
    open: (ws) => {
      console.log('WebSocket connection established');
      ws.send('Welcome!');
    },

    // When a message is received from the client
    message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
      const decodedMessage = Buffer.from(message).toString();
      console.log('Received message:', decodedMessage);
      ws.send(`Echo: ${decodedMessage}`, isBinary);
    },

    // When a client disconnects
    close: (ws, code, message) => {
      console.log('Client disconnected');
    },

    // Handle WebSocket errors
    error: (ws, error) => {
      console.error('WebSocket error:', error);
    }
  })
  .listen(9001, (token) => {
    if (token) {
      console.log('WebSocket server is running on ws://localhost:9001');
    } else {
      console.log('Failed to start the WebSocket server');
    }
  });
```

#### Explanation:
- **`open`**: Triggered when a new WebSocket connection is established.
- **`message`**: Handles incoming messages from clients.
- **`close`**: Triggered when a client disconnects from the server.
- **`error`**: Captures any errors that occur on the WebSocket connection.
